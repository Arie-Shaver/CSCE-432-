    <h2> About me </h2>
        <p> I've had about five years of experience working with various computing platforms and 
            applications, and I hope to continue learning how to use even more technologies. 
            Exploring various aspects of Computers and technology has always been my aspiration, 
            and I'm glad I've had the opportunity to do so from several learning experiences. 
            Computers and their functions have always been a fascination of mine, and I've appreciated 
            being able to study various coding languages, software applications, and hardware concepts
            associated with their design and construction as they relate to computing. 
            It's truly been a joy to research all the vast departments and concentrations that span this
            concept. However, at the moment I've narrowed my interests down to a set of specific aspects 
            of computing that are significantly influential in today's society. My discoveries and
            explorations have shifted toward interactive applications, virtual reality, and 
            artificial intelligence. I would love the opportunity to interact with these technologies 
            and experiment with ideas of how they can be applied to fields within art, humanities, and 
            health. Also, I'd like the opportunity to witness how much depth the field of Computer Science 
            has beyond the zone of functionality. Concepts such as VR arcades, simulation ride parks at 
            Universal Studios, the 4DX theater experience, and other areas of progression are ways 
            Computer Science has extended to entertainment. I believe there are technical components 
            that could be beneficial in multiple and uncommon areas of concentration. 
            Upon completing my Bachelor's Degree, I hope to receive a master's in Information Technology 
            and combine my experiences from Computer Science with it to lead me into a promising career field.
            I aspire to follow a career path in Information Technology where I can either manage these types 
            of technologies or be involved in their front-end development process.
